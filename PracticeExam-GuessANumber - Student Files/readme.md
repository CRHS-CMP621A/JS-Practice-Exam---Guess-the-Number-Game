> 5 buttons to represent the numbers 1 to 5.
> Paragraph location to store result of the guess

Initial Code:
Generate a random number between 1 and 5.
Buttons OnClick:
a> check if the user’s number matches.
b> If match, then display “You Win”. If not correct, display “Keep Guessing”. Either way remove the visibility of the button # that was selected.

Additional:

> New Game button to reset the 5 numbers to display again and generate a new random number.
> EVENTLISTENERS (add or remove) to make it impossible to select another button # after the user guesses correctly. Turn eventlisteners back on when the reset button is pressed.
> Use images: instead of the 5 # buttons and instead of text for the “You Win” / “Keep Guessing”.
> Add a counter for the number of guesses used. Display this count on the page.
